<p>
		Hey there! I'm Victor Nogueira, a software engineer who thrives on turning complex problems into 
		elegant solutions. My journey in tech has been driven by a simple philosophy: ideas are great, 
		but shipping is better. This mindset has led me to not just write code, but build and scale real-world 
		products that users actually love.
	</p>

	<p>
		Currently, I'm wearing two hats that keep my days exciting (and my coffee consumption high). 
    As the founder of <a href="/caraquecoda">@caraquecoda</a>, I lead a software house that transforms client visions into 
    robust digital solutions. Meanwhile, I'm also building <a href="/dochelp">@dochelp.ai</a>, where we're pushing the 
		boundaries of what AI can do in practical, user-focused ways.
	</p>

	<p>
		My technical toolkit spans across the full stack, with a particular fondness for clean 
		architecture and scalable solutions. I've worked with various technologies over the years, 
		but what really gets me excited is not just the tech itself, but how we can use it to solve 
		real problems. Whether it's optimizing performance, improving user experience, or 
		architecting new features, I'm always up for a good technical challenge.
	</p>

	<p>
		Beyond the code, I'm a firm believer in building strong tech communities. I enjoy sharing 
		knowledge, collaborating on open-source projects, and mentoring fellow developers. There's 
		something special about being part of a community where we can all grow together and push 
		each other to be better.
	</p>

	<p>
		When I'm not in front of a computer, you might find me exploring new coffee shops, reading 
		about emerging tech trends, or brainstorming the next big idea. I'm always open to interesting 
		conversations and new opportunities to create something meaningful. If you've got an exciting 
		project or just want to chat about tech, don't hesitate to reach out!
	</p>
